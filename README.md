# Focus on your logic

Stop worrying about how to setup ES6, babel, etc.

Just start coding !

# How

```javascript
npm install --no-optional
npm run test:watch
```

Every time you'll change a file, babel will compile your ES6 code in ES5 and run your tests.

# Why

I was following *Redux* tutorial and in order to play with it, I had to set this up.

Also, when I want to try few things on node I have to setup babel, again and again.
